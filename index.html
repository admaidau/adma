3.0.0 Assessment Task 1: My Profile
</title>
<body>
Name: Daksa Mahatma Alocita<br/>
Student Number: s3812531<br/>
Email Address: me@adma.id.au<br/>
Nationality: Indonesian<br/>
Basic Background: My name is Daksa. I graduated from a vocational high school in technology & networking. I've been into IT ever since I was like 15 years old, my uncle gave me a bulky laptop as a present. I spent most of my spare time in front my computer after school. A few years after, I migrated into Australia and had to work my butt off to just live in Sydney. At the present, I'm working at a car dealership as a parts interpreter for about four years. A few months back I realized that I need to go back to my industry that I've been dreaming of. I learnt most of technology stuff from my vocational school and my spare time after work.<br/><br/>
The vocational school I went to was my turning point. Teachers taught me from IPv4 subnetting to build a laptop. Hopefully I could reach my achievement to be a proper IT person and will create something useful not only my surrounding but also the world as a whole. It might sound cheesy but I do believe the big dream will lead to big goals too, thank you!<br/>
<br/><br/>
What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).<br/>
Answer: My interest in IT is the way it grows rapidly. It started when I was a kid and was given a bulky notebook by my uncle. A person who kicks me off in IT is Bill Gates, a humble guy who does his IT after his successful businesses, he is still look after the poor by donating the most of his wages.
<br/><br/>
Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<br/>
Answer: I actually did not pick RMIT particulary, I joined RMIT as it was the earliest amongst other universities.<br/>
<br/><br/>
What do you expect to learn during your studies?<br/>
Answer: Hopefully I can get into my passion even more, which is IT. It's been my dream ever since I migrated from Indonesia. I expect my IT knowledge would improve, whether it's software or hardware.<br/>
<br/><br/>
Ideal Job: Cryptologic Systems Operator (https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/navy/cryptologic-systems-operator)<br/>
- This job is really interesting to me as it involves national army which is something I interested beside IT. Serving a country you're living in is a special occupation for me.<br/>
- I might be still far away from the requirements; my english level, cryptology knowledge, and IT as a whole. This is may be baby steps, but I won't give up.<br/>
- Being a graduate IT student, I believe I could easily fit into any National Guard softwares. I'm currently a spare parts consultant,  my automobile knowledge was zero and by learning the software, my automobile knowledge has improved heaps better than before. <br/>
- My plan to obtain any missing requirement is by attending any courses to get the certificates and am getting more experiences by working in a company as a team.<br/>
