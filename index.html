</title>
<body>
Name: Daksa Mahatma Alocita<br/>
Student Number: s3812531<br/>
Email Address: me@adma.id.au<br/>
Nationality: Indonesian<br/>
Basic Background: My name is Daksa. I graduated from a vocational high school in technology & networking. I've been into IT ever since I was like 15 years old, my uncle gave me a bulky laptop as a present. I spent most of my spare time in front my computer after school. A few years after, I migrated into Australia and had to work my butt off to just live in Sydney. At the present, I'm working at a car dealership as a parts interpreter for about four years. A few months back I realized that I need to go back to my industry that I've been dreaming of. I learnt most of technology stuff from my vocational school and my spare time after work.<br/><br/>
The vocational school I went to was my turning point. Teachers taught me from IPv4 subnetting to build a laptop. Hopefully I could reach my achievement to be a proper IT person and will create something useful not only my surrounding but also the world as a whole. It might sound cheesy but I do believe the big dream will lead to big goals too, thank you!<br/>
<br/><br/>
What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).<br/>
Answer: My interest in IT is the way it grows rapidly. It started when I was a kid and was given a bulky notebook by my uncle. A person who kicks me off in IT is Bill Gates, a humble guy who does his IT after his successful businesses, he is still look after the poor by donating the most of his wages.
<br/><br/>
Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<br/>
Answer: I actually did not pick RMIT particulary, I joined RMIT as it was the earliest amongst other universities.<br/>
<br/><br/>
What do you expect to learn during your studies?<br/>
Answer: Hopefully I can get into my passion even more, which is IT. It's been my dream ever since I migrated from Indonesia. I expect my IT knowledge would improve, whether it's software or hardware.<br/>
<br/><br/>
Ideal Job: Cryptologic Systems Operator (https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/navy/cryptologic-systems-operator)<br/>
- This job is really interesting to me as it involves national army which is something I interested beside IT. Serving a country you're living in is a special occupation for me.<br/>
- I might be still far away from the requirements; my english level, cryptology knowledge, and IT as a whole. This is may be baby steps, but I won't give up.<br/>
- Being a graduate IT student, I believe I could easily fit into any National Guard softwares. I'm currently a spare parts consultant,  my automobile knowledge was zero and by learning the software, my automobile knowledge has improved heaps better than before. <br/>
- My plan to obtain any missing requirement is by attending any courses to get the certificates and am getting more experiences by working in a company as a team.<br/>

  <center><h1><p>Hotel Check-In Automation</p></h1></center>
<p>Overview:</p>
<p>I believe this new system would improve the hotel check-in system as a whole (World-wide). Plenty of hotels still use a traditional system which takes a quite sometime to progress. I also trust this system as the more accurate than the old-school system. This reflects the airport automated check-in system in Singapore, it&rsquo;s just a blink of eye to pass the counter. It indeed saves some of our time, especially those who are in rush mode or might be on their tight business schedule. In terms of security, this system would require multi-layers of security so that we can reduce any safety concerns regarding this new system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Motivation:</p>
<p>This new system is really to save the world. I believe paperwork is the most big contributor to our degrading planet, all papers and ink are taking the nature out of its existence. Using this complete new system, we&rsquo;re not only save the world but our time achieving all data and necessary documents for basic hotel paperwork. &nbsp;Most of the hotels in the world are still using actual humans to do the check-in which is a quite fluid situation as human can&rsquo;t be predicted at work (There are million reasons for us being upset, happy, or sad). These situations would force hoteliers to fake their real emotions at all time at work.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto Document Verification
<ul>
<li>This function is self-explanatory. It would assess the documents whether they are real or no.</li>
<li>The accreditation of this verification may still need a person to oversee behind a &ldquo;two-way mirror&rdquo; glass.</li>
<li>All guests will be required to submit their standard identification details which is passport. Any other documents would be considered as an invalid document as it&rsquo;s pretty much not efficient for this system to work properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Auto Payment Processing
<ul>
<li>This feature of this system is a straight forward feature, it takes your money. This will let hotel to take credit or debit card payment, this method also reduces the risk of money robbery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mobile Access
<ul>
<li>Hotel will have an option to unlock a feature by an additional subscription. This functions as a mobile application. This application is basically the mobile version of this hotel check-in automation.</li>
<li>It is accessible everywhere on both guest and staff mobiles. It lets the customer to check-in on mobile whilst on their way from airport to hotel. It&rsquo;s a convenience way to check-in so that they may proceed straight to their room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explore Around
<ul>
<li>This is very useful when you stay over in a hotel in an area you&rsquo;re not familiar with. It would ask the guest&rsquo;s email so that it could send out a basic web page contains all information in the surrounding area.</li>
<li>Explore Around features a guide hire for any foreigners who are unfamiliar with the surrounding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chat With A Human
<ul>
<li>I believe some of the guests might not like this new system as they&rsquo;re kind of old school persons</li>
<li>This would allow guests to actually talk to a staff hotel if the process didn&rsquo;t go as planned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connection Plan
<ul>
<li>This feature will map out the whole itinerary of a guest. This would keep the guest updated on their schedule so that they won&rsquo;t miss out any particular event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hotel Room Access
<ul>
<li>Through this system, it won&rsquo;t be needing any card to get into a hotel room. As soon as the payment gone through, it will give the guest some sort of PIN so that they can access their hotel room.</li>
<li>In the process of accessing the hotel room, each PIN has a unique code and it refers to the main person who paid the booking in full.</li>
<li>This PIN may be shared to any other persons who were registered as guests from the booking form in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Archiving System
<ul>
<li>This new system would allow the hotel to manage their archives in a server. All data will be encrypted and are to be accessed by any staff with prompt level of employment.</li>
<li>Some of the staff are allowed to access this archive for guest relation purposes.</li>
<li>This system helps the hotel itself to keep the storage area in a tiny space so that the hotel would use the unused space for something else to improve its quality and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools &amp; Technologies</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi-spec dedicated server and storage rack.
<ul>
<li>As this is a big project, we want to make sure everything goes as we wanted without any hassle because of the server&rsquo;s specification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well-designed Local Area Network with a high-speed internet.
<ul>
<li>One of the solutions to create a better framework to a company networking system. This would also let the company to freely upgrade as they go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic computer to run the GUI of hotel check in automation.
<ul>
<li>A platform which will allow guests to interact with the automated check-in system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Payment terminal
<ul>
<li>It will be functioning as the hotel&rsquo;s payment gateway. This terminal would be interconnected to the base check in system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Authentication Program
<ul>
<li>This is one of the most important components to our check-in system. It needs a group of expertise in security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skills Required</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic company management skill</li>
<li>IT security skill</li>
<li>Required softwares &amp; language:
<ul>
<li>Eclipse for base program creation</li>
<li>Java, C++, &amp; Phyton</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Special hardware:
<ul>
<li>Facial recognition &amp; fingerprint scanner devices</li>
<li>EFTpost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leadership skill</li>
<li>Basic hotel knowledgement</li>
<li>Computer networking skill</li>
<li>Problem solving skill</li>
<li>Being able to submit proposal to other supporting companies so that this project will be sponsored and would save the project costing.</li>
<li>Highly trained IT individuals to speed up the project progression.</li>
<li>Basic promotion and marketing skill</li>
<li>Control room operator skill</li>
<li>Expert algorithm knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oucome:</p>
<p>The outcome of this project is widely broad. It does save the nature and in the same time it would reduce the labour cost to the hotel. Hotel expenses are getting higher year by year due to inflation in the world. This IT project will bring a really big impact to the hotel industry. All consideration will be taken into account, one of the most important things is staff&rsquo;s mental growth. I do believe if a company has taken care their staff all the way to the entry level, they would return the favour by working their butt off to support the company they are working for.</p>
